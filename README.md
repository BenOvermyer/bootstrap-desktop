# Bootstrap Desktop

This is the process by which I initially kit out an Ubuntu Budgie-based computer.

It's designed to be run as soon after a fresh install as possible. The only prerequisites are git and an Internet connection.

## Steps

1. Install Ubuntu Budgie 18.04.
2. Login and open Tilix.
3. Install git. (`sudo apt install git`)
4. Checkout this repository.
5. Run the bootstrap script (`sudo ./bootstrap.sh`)
